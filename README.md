# KNN Image Classification Project - Team A

## Overview

An introductory AI project implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification for real-world vehicle and pedestrian detection. This project focuses on understanding overfitting, regularization techniques, and fundamental machine learning mathematics through hands-on image classification.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand overfitting** and how to fix it using penalty regularization
- **Learn simple graph visualization** for performance analysis
- **Cover basic mathematics of machine learning** through practical implementation

## Project Requirements

### Dataset Classes
The project classifies the following real-world objects:
- Motorcycles
- Cars  
- Trucks
- Pedestrians
- Cyclists

All images should be compressed to **32x32 pixels** for consistency.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Find clear images of the target classes in real-world settings
2. **Data Preparation**: Label pictures and split into training and test datasets
   - Constraint: `|training data| <= |test data|`
3. **Data Processing**: Implement dataset and image processing pipeline
4. **KNN Implementation**: Build custom KNN classifier and test performance
5. **Performance Analysis**: Plot performance vs. model complexity for both training and test datasets (I suggest using AI for the plots, but doing everything elsemanually)
6. **Optimization**: Implement penalty regularization to prevent overfitting and repeat analysis

## Must Have Features

- âœ… **Custom KNN implementation** (no external KNN libraries)
- âœ… **Overfitting analysis** with visual bias-variance tradeoff plots
- âœ… **Decision classifier** achieving >80% validation accuracy
- âœ… **Comprehensive technical documentation**

## Nice to Have Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Cross evaluation** on test vs training data
- ðŸŽ¯ **Hyperparameter optimization** using grid search
